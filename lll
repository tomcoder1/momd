Your essays are generally well-structured and convey your ideas clearly. However, there are some areas that could be improved to achieve higher scores:

Grammar and Sentence Structure:

In both essays, there are grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures. Ensure that your sentences are clear and free from grammatical mistakes. Proofreading your essays can help.
Vocabulary Usage:

While you have used a reasonable range of vocabulary, there is room for improvement. Try to incorporate more precise and varied vocabulary to enhance the quality of your essays.
Clarity and Precision:

Some of your sentences could benefit from being clearer and more precise. Avoid wordiness and convoluted sentence structures that can confuse the reader.
Development of Counter-arguments:

In both essays, you presented counter-arguments but didn't develop them fully. To achieve higher scores, ensure that you provide a balanced discussion by elaborating on opposing viewpoints.
Introduction and Conclusion:

While your essays have introductions and conclusions, they could be more engaging and concise. Clearly state your thesis in the introduction and summarize your main points in the conclusion.
Word Count:

The second essay is quite short. Aim for essays of around 250-300 words to fully develop your ideas and provide ample detail.
Punctuation and Spelling:

Pay attention to punctuation and spelling to avoid errors that can detract from the overall quality of your essays.
Consistency:

Ensure consistency in terms of language use, tense, and style throughout your essays.
Supporting Details:

Providing specific examples or evidence to support your points can strengthen your essays. Add statistics, real-life examples, or hypothetical scenarios where relevant.
Complex Sentences:

While your essays include complex sentences, make sure they are used effectively to convey your ideas without making the text unnecessarily complex.
To improve your IELTS Task 2 essays and aim for higher scores, it's essential to focus on these areas and practice writing essays regularly. Consider seeking feedback from teachers or language experts to pinpoint and address specific weaknesses.
